# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Visits-Dashboard

# Overview
This project provides a data analysis dashboard designed to offer insights into patient visits to the Emergency Room (ER). The dashboard includes interactive visualizations, time-based trends, and key metrics that help healthcare providers understand patient flow, patient satisfaction, demographics, referral patterns, and more. It is built using Power BI (or any other BI tool you used for visualization) and incorporates various measures to track the hospital's ER performance and operational efficiency.

  The average waiting time card can help highlight potential issues related to ER efficiency, especially during peak times (e.g., weekends or certain months). 
  
Staff Distribution:
